## Course Description

This course surveys the methods – both classical and emergent – powering today’s modern robot systems. Topics will span a range of applications and technologies, with particular emphasis robot learning and interactive systems. The class will include reviews of key robotics concepts, training in research skills, critical reading and discussion of influential and recent literature (with student-led presentations), and a final research-oriented project.

<!-- ## Prerequisites

Previous programming experience is required. Students entering this class are expected to have background knowledge in calculus, linear algebra, and probability. Students who do not fit this profile must seek permission from the instructor prior to enrolling.

(COMP SCI 400 or 320) and (MATH 320, 340, 341, 345 or 375) and (STAT 311, 324, 333, 340, 371, STAT/MATH 309, 431, MATH 331 or 531) -->


## Additional References

None of the textbooks are required, though you may find them helpful to aid in your learning (particularly in primers/scaffolding for the research we discuss in class). All texbooks are available for free online.

 ## Discussion Forum

The instructor will post announcements, etc. on Piazza.  
Students should check and engage with the CS839 Piazza page frequently throughout the term.  
If you have a question, the best option is to post a message on Piazza.

If your question is personal or not of interest to others, you may mark your question as **private** on Piazza so only instructors will see it.  
You are also welcome to come to office hours for individual discussion.

## Grading

Grading will be based on:

- Participation (e.g., attendance, in-class discussion, piazza posts for asynchronous discussion): 20%
- Implementation Assignment: 15%
- Paper Reviews and Presentations: 25%
- Final Project: 40%
