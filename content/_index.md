## Course Description

Robots are intelligent systems that plan, sense, and act on the physical world. The course offers an introduction to the different modeling and algorithmic approaches used broadly in robotics. By the end of this course, students should have a fundamental understanding of essential topics for building robot systems; including representations, kinematics, motion planning, perception, and control. This course emphasizes two classes of robot systems: manipulator arms and wheeled mobile platforms. Learning will take place through lectures, interactive discussions, hands-on programming assignments using simulated robots, and a final capstone project.

## Prerequisites

Previous programming experience is required. Students entering this class are expected to have background knowledge in calculus, linear algebra, and probability. Students who do not fit this profile must seek permission from the instructor prior to enrolling.

(COMP SCI 400 or 320) and (MATH 320, 340, 341, 345 or 375) and (STAT 311, 324, 333, 340, 371, STAT/MATH 309, 431, MATH 331 or 531)


## Recommended Textbooks

None of the textbooks are required, though you may find them helpful to aid in your learning. All of the texbooks are available for free online.

- [*Modern Robotics*](https://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/images/2/25/MR-v2.pdf)<br>Lynch and Park
- [*Introduction to Autonomous Robots: Mechanisms, Sensors, Actuators, and Algorithms*](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Autonomous-Robots/Introduction-to-Autonomous-Robots)<br>Correll, Hayes, Heckman, and Roncone
<!--- *Probabilistic Robotics*, Thrun, Burgard, and Fox-->


## Discussion Forum

The instructor will post announcements, clarifications, hints, etc. on Piazza.  
Students should check the CS639 Piazza page frequently throughout the term.  
If you have a question, the best option is to post a message on Piazza.

Helpful guidelines:
- Please check if someone has posted the same/similar question before yours; it’s easier if we build on the thread.
- Use an informative "Summary" line to help others.

If your question is personal or not of interest to others, you may mark your question as **private** on Piazza so only instructors will see it.  
You are also welcome to come to office hours for individual discussion.

## Grading

Grading will be based on:

- Participation (e.g., polls, responses, feedback): 5%
- Programming Assignments: 40%
- Midterm Exam: 30%
- Final Project: 25%
