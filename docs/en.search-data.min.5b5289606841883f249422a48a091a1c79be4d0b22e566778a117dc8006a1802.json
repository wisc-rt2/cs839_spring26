Here we will look at an example modular system as well as a technique (developed at UW-Madison) for inverse kinematics which is a critical stack component for most approaches today.\nDexPilot: Vision-Based Teleoperation of Dexterous Robotic Hand–Arm Systems RelaxedIK: Real-time Synthesis of Accurate and Feasible Robot Arm Motion Class 5 — Tue, Feb 3, 2026\nTopic: Fundamentals 3: Planning Motions\nGoal: Review of common planning techiques and a more recent approach for planning around complex obstacles.\nMotion Planning: The Essentials Motion Planning Around Obstacles with Convex Optimization Additional Resources:\nCollision-Affording Point Trees: SIMD-Amenable Nearest Neighbors for Fast Collision Checking *(recent high-performance path planning RSS paper)* 🤖 Module 2: Learning# Class 6 — Thu, Feb 5, 2026\nTopic: Learning Primer\nGoal: Review high-level architectures/approaches to robot learning, including imitation learning, RL, and IRL.\nSlides: LINK Additional Resources:\nALVINN: AN AUTONOMOUS LAND VEHICLE IN A NEURAL NETWORK (original BC paper). Class 7 — Tue, Feb 10, 2026\nTopic: Learning 1: Foundations\nGoal: Review classical learning techniques, including movement primitives and behavior cloning.\nMovement Primitives Behavioral Cloning from Observation Additional Resources:\nGenerative Adversarial Imitation Learning (another historical but more recent approach to imitation learning) Class 8 — Thu, Feb 12, 2026\nTopic: Learning 2: End-to-End \u0026 Meta-Learning\nGoal: The first paper was a bit moment in robotics that demonstrated learning could be achieved without intermediate representations (pixels to motor torques). The second paper was an influential early work about adopting existing models to new tasks (toward better robot learning generalization).\nEnd-to-End Learning Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks Class 9 — Tue, Feb 17, 2026\nTopic: Learning 3: Intermediate Representations in Learning\nGoal: We will look at two learning approaches that anchor on an intermediate representation: IRL where the model infers a reward function and 'yell at your robot' which has a high-level and low-level policy.\nMaximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning Yell At Your Robot: Improving On-the-Fly from Language Corrections Class 10 — Thu, Feb 19, 2026\nTopic: Literature Review Workshop\nGoal: We will discuss stratgies for finding relevant research literature and do an in-class exercise where we search for papers related to a topic.\nSlides: LINK Class 11 — Tue, Feb 24, 2026\nTopic: Learning 4: The Rise of Generative Learning\nGoal: Two papers representing an inflection point in robot learning where LLMs and generative models began to really take off in robotics.\nDo As I Can, Not As I Say: Grounding Language in Robotic Affordances Diffusion Policy: Visuomotor Policy Learning via Action Diffusion Class 12 — Thu, Feb 26, 2026\nTopic: Learning 5: Practical Considerations in Learning\nGoal: Recent learning methods have less parameter sensitivity, but there are still many small considerations that can make or break learning systems.\nWhat Matters in Learning from Offline Data On the Continuity of Rotation Representations in Neural Networks Additional Resources:\nMuch Ado About Noising: Dispelling the Myths of Generative Robotic Control (recent paper challenging the need of high capacity generative models in learning) Class 13 — Tue, Mar 3, 2026\nTopic: Learning 6: Frontiers\nGoal: (to be filled)\nπ∗0.6: a VLA That Learns From Experience mimic-video: Video-Action Models for Generalizable Robot Control Beyond VLAs Additional Resources:\nLINK 🧠 Module 3: Interactive Systems# Class 14 — Thu, Mar 5, 2026\nTopic: Interactive Systems Primer\nGoal: Introduce challenges, approaches, and considerations for systems that work around and with people.\nSlides: LINK Class 15 — Tue, Mar 10, 2026\nTopic: Interactive Systems 1: Teleoperation \u0026 Simplifying Human Input\nGoal: (to be filled)\nTeleoperation Learning Latent Actions Additional Resources:\nLINK Class 16 — Thu, Mar 12, 2026\nTopic: Implement Something: Mini Presentations\nGoal: (to be filled)\nStudent presentations Additional Resources:\nLINK Class 17 — Tue, Mar 17, 2026\nTopic: Async: Learning-Based Models (Tedrake)\nGoal: (to be filled)\nRecorded lecture Additional Resources:\nLINK Class 18 — Thu, Mar 19, 2026\nTopic: Async: Cognition \u0026 Robotics (Brooks)\nGoal: (to be filled)\nSelected readings Additional Resources:\nLINK Class 19 — Tue, Mar 24, 2026\nTopic: Interactive Systems 2: Human–Robot Collaboration\nGoal: (to be filled)\nPolicy Blending Formalism Goal Inference Improves Objective and Perceived Performance in Human–Robot Collaboration Additional Resources:\nLINK Class 20 — Thu, Mar 26, 2026\nTopic: Interactive Systems 3: Shared Autonomy\nGoal: (to be filled)\nA Policy Blending Formalism To the Noise and Back Additional Resources:\nLINK Spring Break: Tue, Mar 31 \u0026amp; Thu, Apr 2 (No class)\n🧪 Module 4: Simulation \u0026amp; Safety# Class 21 — Tue, Apr 7, 2026\nTopic: Interactive Systems 4: Minimizing User Input\nGoal: (to be filled)\nAsking Easy Questions REALM Additional Resources:\nLINK Class 22 — Thu, Apr 9, 2026\nTopic: Simulation \u0026 Sim-to-Real\nGoal: (to be filled)\nSelected papers Additional Resources:\nLINK Class 23 — Tue, Apr 14, 2026\nTopic: Safety in Robotics\nGoal: (to be filled)\nSelected papers Additional Resources:\nLINK 🚀 Module 5: Applications \u0026amp; Projects# Class 24 — Thu, Apr 16, 2026\nTopic: Applications 1\nGoal: (to be filled)\nSLAM (Luca) Marine Robotics (WHOI) Additional Resources:\nLINK Class 25 — Tue, Apr 21, 2026\nTopic: Applications 2\nGoal: (to be filled)\nHumanoids (DARPA) Quadrupeds Additional Resources:\nLINK Class 26 — Thu, Apr 23, 2026\nTopic: Applications 3\nGoal: (to be filled)\nAssistive Robotics (FEAST) UAVs \u0026amp; Drone Racing Additional Resources:\nLINK Class 27 — Tue, Apr 28, 2026\nTopic: Project Presentations I\nGoal: (to be filled)\nStudent presentations Additional Resources:\nLINK Class 28 — Thu, Apr 30, 2026\nTopic: Project Presentations II\nGoal: (to be filled)\nStudent presentations Additional Resources:\nLINK "}]
